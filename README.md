## Tabs in the GUI

#### Control Panel Tab

When you open the GUI this is the first tab which opens. The goal of this software is to navigate you through the entire data analysis pipeline, started from the raw fastq files from the sequencer.  It will also save intermediary files, so that if you have done this analysis before you can skip to plotting the samples.  Here is what this tab looks like:
